Python text-based menu

Assignment 1
SUBMIT original code in Python to solve the problem below.  
Please be aware that copying and pasting code from any other source other than code you have explicitly written on your own is considered plagiarism.  If you receive help, that is fine (document help in the comments of your code) however you need to write your own code, name your own variables, and comment your own code. Students turning in the exact same work as another student will all be given zeros. Plagiarism is not tolerated, and students found to be plagiarizing will be given a zero and reported to the University with the possibility of termination of the class and degree program.
